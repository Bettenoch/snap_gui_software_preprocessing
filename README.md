# üõ∞Ô∏è Hydrosafe Leak Data Preprocessing Pipeline

**HYS Leak Data Preprocessing** is a geospatial data engineering project designed to automate the end-to-end preprocessing of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for underground water leak detection.  
The pipeline leverages ESA SNAP‚Äôs Graph Processing Tool (GPT) inside Docker containers to transform raw `.SAFE` scenes into georeferenced, analysis-ready `.tif` datasets ‚Äî ready for downstream machine learning and geospatial analytics workflows.

## üåç Project Overview

Municipal water utilities and infrastructure companies often rely on ground inspections to detect leaks in underground pipelines.  
This project aims to complement those efforts by **building a large-scale Sentinel-1 preprocessing pipeline** that aligns satellite radar data with **known leak events** ‚Äî enabling the creation of training datasets for predictive leak detection models.

Key capabilities include:

- ‚úÖ Automated ingestion of Sentinel-1 `.SAFE` scenes  
- ‚úÖ Standardized preprocessing (orbit correction, calibration, speckle filtering, terrain correction)  
- ‚úÖ Scene clipping based on geospatial leak locations  
- ‚úÖ Batch generation of **positive** (leak) and **negative** (non-leak) samples  
- ‚úÖ Cloud-ready and containerized for scalable deployments  

---

## üß≠ Project Workflow

The pipeline will eventually automate the following stages:

---

### 1. **Data Ingestion**  
- Read `.SAFE` Sentinel-1 scenes from local storage or an external archive.  
- Scenes are typically shared across multiple ground points within the same region.

---

### 2. **Preprocessing with SNAP GPT**  
- Apply orbit files  
- Remove thermal noise  
- Calibrate backscatter intensity  
- Apply speckle filtering  
- Perform terrain correction  
- Export as a georeferenced `.tif`

---

### 3. **Clipping Based on Ground Truth**  
- Read a dataset of known leak points from an Excel sheet (4,200+ points from 2022‚Äì2024 in Mexico).  
- Clip the preprocessed scene using a coordinate buffer around each leak location (positive samples).  
- Generate random background samples from non-leak areas for negative training data.

### 4. **Batch Processing & Scaling**  
- Parallelize the workflow for thousands of scenes.  
- Deploy on a cloud VM or container orchestrator for large-scale processing.

## üìä Example Use Case

- **Input:**  
  - Sentinel-1 `.SAFE` scene (`S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20250826T005018_20250826T005043_060700_078DB4_E255.SAFE`)  
  - Leak dataset (`leaks.xlsx` with location, detection date, fix date)

- **Output:**  
  - Preprocessed `.tif` image ready for analysis  
  - Cropped SAR tiles for each leak point (positive samples)  
  - Random non-leak tiles (negative samples)

During initial testing, a single scene preprocessing run on a local machine (RAM + CPU) completed successfully in **~15 minutes**, producing a fully terrain-corrected `.tif`.

---

## üê≥ Dockerized Processing

The entire pipeline runs inside Docker using ESA SNAP‚Äôs GPT. This ensures portability, reproducibility, and easy scaling.

### üß™ Quick Test Run (Manual)

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/data" mundialis/esa-snap \
  gpt /data/graphs/graph.xml \
  -Pinput="/data/s1_inputs/<SCENE>.SAFE/manifest.safe" \
  -Poutput="/data/s1_outputs/<SCENE>_preprocessed.tif"
````

This command:

* Mounts your project directory to `/data` inside the container
* Executes the SNAP processing graph defined in `graphs/graph.xml`
* Outputs a georeferenced `.tif` into `s1_outputs/`
